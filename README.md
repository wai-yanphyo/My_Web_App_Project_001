***Company Description***

	Anywhere Property Myanmar is a real estate listing platform with around 15 employees focused on connecting property seekers with landlords and agents across Myanmar. The company provides property listings for sale and rent but currently operates with limited interactivity and outdated design. The platform aims to modernize its services by developing a full-featured web application to improve user experience and business growth.

***Weaknesses of the Existing Website***

	The current website of Anywhere Myanmar Real Estate (https://anywhereproperty.com.mm) faces several limitations that hinder user experience, scalability, and operational efficiency. These weaknesses are categorized as follows:

1. Design & User Interface (UI)

Outdated visual design that does not align with modern web design standards.

Non-responsive layout — poor usability on smartphones and tablets.

Lack of interactive elements such as animations, transitions, or visual feedback that enhance user engagement.


2. Search Functionality

Limited to basic keyword searches with no intelligence or structure.

No advanced filters for users and endusers to refine search by:

Number of bedrooms or bathrooms

Other Facilityies

Cannot work filters as well.

No sorting options for search results (e.g., by price, date added, or popularity).


3. Content Management

Property listings appear static (not fully dynamic), likely requiring manual updates through WordPress admin.

No real-time data sync — changes do not reflect immediately for users.

No custom backend system for property agents to manage listings, photos, or statuses (e.g., sold/rented).



4. User Features

No login/registration system for buyers, renters, or agents.

No ability to save favorite properties or set viewing preferences.

No built-in messaging system to directly contact agents or schedule viewings.


5. Technical Limitations

Built on outdated technologies, possibly static HTML with legacy PHP on WordPress.

Lacks proper database integration — no dynamic listing management (no CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Poor SEO optimization, which limits visibility on search engines like Google.

Not scalable or modular, making future upgrades costly and complex.

***Project Objective***

To develop a web application that improves the performance, usability, and features of a real estate rental website in Myanmar.
